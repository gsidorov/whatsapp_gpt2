I will analyze the messages written with Nacho and create a model that talk likes him. Then I will make them talk one to each other. 
Maybe I should write like a bot that does this, I could have a model for short, ,medium and large messages.
Then also a way of randomize how often to reply and the number of messages. another cool feature would be to have some kind of sentiment analysis of the messages. 
Then it would be also cool to have a matrix of personalities, for example, if we have put the personality of the bot as "angry", 
he will push "angry" messages (which can be done with the help of the prompt) against "peaceful" or just "informative" message, 
maybe there is a way of even creating some kind of "passive-aggressive" mode. Then if you have a "peaceful" character, he will try to diverge the conversatoin
into something "chill" or "romantic".Another cool thing that we could do detect the mood of the messages would be to do it with a text sentiment tool.
This is quite some of an idea.
